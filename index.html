    <p>psychology, the science which treats of the mind and its powers and its functions. There is no doubt that as research in psychology and mental health progresses, We are certain that as truth unfolds, the positions taken here will appeal more and more to all thoughtful readers. <br> <br>

There is perfect harmony between the Bible and true science. Psychology is the science and the study of the mind and human behaviour.

<br> <br>
The counsels in scores of instances addressed to an executive, minister, physician, teacher, editor, husband, housewife, or youth, may in their revelation of circumstances and advice given, partake somewhat of the form of case histories. Attention should be directed to the principle involved. <br>

<br>
True education includes the whole being. It teaches the right use of one’s self. It enables us to make the best use of brain, bone, and muscle, of body, mind, and heart. The faculties of the mind, as the higher powers, are to rule the kingdom of the body.

<p>
To deal with minds is the nicest work in which men ever engaged. </p>
<ul>
<li> <b>To Know the Laws That Govern Mind and Body</b>—It is the duty of every person, for his own sake and for the sake of humanity, to inform himself in regard to the laws of life and conscientiously to obey them. All need to become acquainted with that most wonderful of all organisms, the human body. They should understand the functions of the various organs and the dependence of one upon another for the healthy action of all. They should study the influence of the mind upon the body and of the body upon the mind, and the laws by which they are governed

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Train and Discipline the Mind</b>—No matter who you are ... the Lord has blessed you with intellectual faculties capable of vast improvement. Cultivate your talents with persevering earnestness. Train and discipline the mind by study, by observation, by reflection. You cannot meet the mind of God unless you put to use every power. The mental faculties will strengthen and develop if you will go to work in the fear of God, in humility, and with earnest prayer. A resolute purpose Will accomplish wonders.


</li><br>
<li>
<b>Potential of the Disciplined Mind</b>—Self-discipline must be practiced.... An ordinary mind, well disciplined, will accomplish more and higher work than will the most highly educated mind and the greatest talents without self-control

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Understanding Minds of Great Value in Dealing with the Sick</b>—Great wisdom is needed in dealing with diseases caused through the mind. A sore, sick heart, a discouraged mind, needs mild treatment.... Sympathy and tact will often prove a greater benefit to the sick than will the most skilful treatment given in a cold, indifferent way.

</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>The Duty of Every person to Develop Mind</b>—It is the duty of every person to acquire habits of order, thoroughness, and dispatch. There is no excuse for slow bungling at work of any character. When one is always at work and the work is never done, it is because mind and heart are not put into the labour. The one who is slow and who works at a disadvantage should realize that these are faults to be corrected. He needs to exercise his mind in planning how to use the time so as to secure the best results. By tact and method, some will accomplish as much in five hours as others do in ten. <b></b> Some who are engaged in domestic labour are always at work, not because they have so much to do but because they do not plan so as to save time. By their slow, dilatory ways they make much work out of very little. But all who will may overcome these fussy, lingering habits. In their work let them have a definite aim. Decide how long a time is required for a given task, and then bend every effort toward accomplishing the work in  the given time. The exercise of the willpower will make the hands move deftly

</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>The Cultivated Mind Measures the Man</b>—Never think that you have learned enough and that you may now relax your efforts. The cultivated mind is the measure of the man. Your education should continue during your lifetime; every day you should be learning and putting to practical use the knowledge gained

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Acquiring Knowledge and Mental Culture</b>—Upon the right improvement of our time depends our success in acquiring knowledge and mental culture. The cultivation of the intellect need not be prevented by poverty, humble origin, or unfavourable surroundings.... A resolute purpose, persistent industry, and careful economy of time will enable men to acquire knowledge and mental discipline which will qualify them for almost any position of influence and usefulness

<p>
There is perfect harmony between the Bible and true science. Psychology is the science and study of the mind and human behaviour
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<b>Laws of the Mind Ordained by God</b>—He who created the mind and ordained its laws, provided for its development in accordance with them.
</li><br>
<li><b>True Principles of Psychology in Scriptures</b>—The true principles  of psychology are found in the Holy Scriptures. Man knows not his own value. He acts according to his unconverted temperament of character because he does not look unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of his faith. He who comes to Jesus, he who believes on Him and makes Him his Example, realizes the meaning of the words <b>“To them gave the power to become the sons of God.”</b> </li>

<li><br>
<b>Mind Devoted to God Develops Harmoniously</b>—God takes  men as they are and educates them for His service if they will yield themselves to Him. The Spirit of God, received into the soul, quickens all its faculties. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit the mind that is devoted unreservedly to God develops harmoniously, and is strengthened to comprehend and fulfil the requirements of God. The weak, vacillating character becomes changed to one of strength hand steadfastness.
</li><br>
<li>
<b>The Science of a Pure Christian Life</b>—The science of a pure, wholesome, consistent Christian life is obtained by studying the Word of the Lord. This is the highest education that any earthly being can obtain.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Surrounded With an Atmosphere of Peace</b>—All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for communion with their own hearts, with nature, and with God.... We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, “Be still, and know that I am God.” ... Amid the hurrying throngs and the strain of life’s intense activities he who is thus refreshed will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will receive a new endowment of both physical and mental strength.


</li><br>
<li>
<b>All Undue Anxieties Dismissed</b>—When men go forth to their daily toil, as when they engage in prayer; when they lie down at night, and when they rise in the morning; when the rich man feasts in his palace, or when the poor man gathers his children about the scanty board, each is tenderly watched by the heavenly Father. No tears are shed that God does not notice. There is no smile that He does not mark. <br> If we would but fully believe this, all undue anxieties would be dismissed. Our lives would not be so filled with disappointment as now; for everything, whether great or small, would be left in the hands of God, who is not perplexed by the multiplicity of cares or overwhelmed by their weight. We should then enjoy a rest of soul to which many have long been strangers.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Every Sin Cherished Weakens the Character</b>—And let none flatter themselves that sins cherished for a time can easily be given up by and by. This is not so. Every sin cherished weakens the character and strengthens habit; and physical, mental, and moral depravity is the result. You may repent of the wrong you have done, and set your feet in right paths; but the mold of your mind and your familiarity with evil will make it difficult for you to distinguish between right and wrong.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Right Excludes Wrong</b>—Parents, you are the ones to decide whether the minds of your children shall be filled with ennobling thoughts or with vicious sentiments. You cannot keep their active minds unoccupied, neither can you frown away evil. Only by the inculcation of right principles can you exclude wrong thoughts.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Only One Day Is Mine</b>—Day by day we are all to be trained, disciplined, and educated for usefulness in this life. Only one day at a time—think of this. One day is mine. I will in this one day do my best. I will use my talent of speech to be a blessing to some other one, a helper, a comforter, an example which the Lord my Saviour shall approve. I will exercise myself in patience, kindness, forbearance, that the Christian virtues may be developed in me today.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>How Well-balanced Minds May Be Developed</b>—Labour is a blessing. It is impossible for us to enjoy health without labour. All the faculties should be called into use that they may be properly developed and that men and women may have well-balanced minds.

<header>A Healthy Normality</header>
<article>
<p>
There are persons with a diseased imagination to whom religion is a tyrant, ruling them as with a rod of iron. Such are constantly mourning over their depravity and groaning over supposed evil. Love does not exist in their hearts; a frown is ever upon their countenances. They are chilled with the innocent laugh from the youth or from anyone. They consider all recreation or amusement a sin and think that the mind must be constantly wrought up to just such a stern, severe pitch. This is one extreme.<br> Others think that the mind must be ever on the stretch to invent new amusements and diversions in order to gain health. They learn to depend on excitement, and are uneasy without it.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Neither Cold Orthodoxy Nor Careless Liberalism</b>—The progress of reform depends upon a clear recognition of fundamental truth. While, on the one hand, danger lurks in a narrow philosophy and a hard, cold orthodoxy, on the other hand there is great danger in a careless liberalism.


</li><br>

<li>
<b>Well-balanced Minds Needed</b>—Much is said in the Epistles of being sound in the faith. This should teach us the necessity of caution. We must not weave into our experience our own inclinations and strong traits of character. This will misrepresent the precious, elevating, ennobling principles of truth and lead others astray.


</li><br>

<li>
<b>All Faculties to Be Cultivated</b>—If certain faculties are used to the neglect of others, the design of God is not fully carried out in us, for all the faculties have a bearing and are dependent, in a great measure, upon one another. One cannot be effectually used without the operation of all, that the balance may be carefully preserved.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Call All Powers of Mind Into Use</b>—All the powers of the mind should be called into use and developed in order for men and women to have well-balanced minds. The world is full of one-sided men and women who have become such because one set of their  faculties was cultivated while others were dwarfed from inaction. The education of most youth is a failure. They overstudy, while they neglect that which pertains to practical business life. Men and women become parents without considering their responsibilities, and their offspring sink lower in the scale of human deficiency than they themselves. Thus the race is fast degenerating.
</li><br>
<li>
<b>Means of Improvement With in Reach of All</b>—Young men are wanted who are men of understanding, who appreciate the intellectual faculties that God has given them and cultivate them with the utmost care’

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Faculties of Mind to Rule the Body</b>—True education includes the whole being. It teaches the right use of one’s self. It enables us to make the best use of brain, bone, and muscle, of body, mind, and heart. The faculties of the mind, as the higher powers, are to rule the kingdom of the body.
</li><br>
<li>
<b>Powers of Mind and Body—</b>the Gift of God—The requirements of God must be brought home to the conscience. Men and [55] women must be awakened to the duty of self-mastery, the need of purity, freedom from every depraving appetite and defiling habit. They need to be impressed with the fact that all their powers of mind and body are the gift of God and are to be preserved in the best possible condition for His service</li>

<header>Disease That Begins in the Mind</header>
<article>

<p> Too Little Thought Given to Causative Factors—Far too little thought is given to the causes underlying the mortality, the disease and degeneracy, that exist today even in the most civilized and favoured lands. The human race is deteriorating. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Nine Tenths of Diseases Originate in Mind</b>—Sickness of the mind prevails everywhere. Nine tenths of the diseases from which men suffer have their foundation here. Perhaps some living home trouble is, like a canker, eating to the very soul and weakening the life-forces. Remorse for sin sometimes undermines the constitution andunbalancesthemind.
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Mind Affects Body</b>—The relation which exists between the mind and the body is very intimate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes. The condition of the mind affects the health of the physical system. If the mind is free and happy, from a consciousness of right doing and a sense of satisfaction in causing happiness to others, it creates a cheerfulness that will react upon the whole system, causing a freer circulation of the blood and a toning up of the entire body.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Brain   Controls the Body</b>—There are many invalids today who will ever remain so because they cannot be convinced that their experience is not reliable. The brain is the capital of the body, the seat of all the nervous forces and of mental action. The nerves proceeding from the brain control the body.

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Tobacco Benumbs the Sensibilities</b>—Tobacco, in whatever form it is used, tells upon the constitution. It is a slow poison. It affects the brain and benumbs the sensibilities so that the mind cannot clearly discern spiritual things, especially those truths which would have a tendency to correct this filthy indulgence.

</li><br>

<li><b>Understanding Different Needs</b></li><br>
<li><b>Overtaxing the Mind</b>—The student who desires to put the work of two years into one should not be permitted to have his own way. To undertake to do double work means, with many, overtaxation of the mind and neglect of physical exercise</li><br>

<article>
<p>God bestows upon us talents for wise improvement, not for abuse. Education is but a preparation of the physical, intellectual, and moral powers for the best performance of all the duties of life. Improper reading gives an education that is false. The power of endurance and the strength and activity of the brain may be lessened or increased according to the manner in which they are employed.</p>
<ul><br>
<li>
<b>Healthful Food for the Mind</b>—Pure healthful reading will be to the mind what healthful food is to the body. You will thus become stronger to resist temptation, to form right habits, and to act upon right principles. </li><br>

<li>
<b>Guard the Avenues of the Soul</b> “Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest,whatsoeverthingsarejust,whatsoeverthingsarepure,whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things” (Philippians 4:8).
</li><br>

<li>
<b>Character Revealed by Choice of Reading</b>—The nature of one’s religious experience is revealed by the character of the books one chooses to read in one’s leisure moments. In order to have a healthy tone of mind and sound religious principles, the youth must live in communion with God through His Word. </li><br>

<li>
<b>Some Books Confuse the Mind</b>—Many of the books piled up in the great libraries of earth confuse the mind more than they aid the understanding. Yet men spend large sums of money in the purchase of such books, and years in their study, when they have within their reach a Book containing the words of Him who is the Alpha and Omega of wisdom.
</li><br>
<li>
<b>Superficial Reading Produces Diseased Imagination </b>—There [110] are many of our youth whom God has endowed with superior capabilities. He has given them the very best of talents; but their powers have been enervated, their minds confused and enfeebled, and for years they have made no growth in grace and in a knowledge of the reasons of our faith, because they have gratified a taste for story reading.

<p>The law of obedient action is worthy of careful study. Action not only advances physical health but brings us into harmony with others and with the universe </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Exercise in the Open Air</b>—The whole system needs the invigorating influence of exercise in the open air. A few hours of manual labour each day would tend to renew the bodily vigour and rest and relax the mind.</li><br>

<li>
<b>Judicious Regulation of Exercise</b>—Well-directed physical exercise, using the strength but not abusing it, would prove an effective remedial agent
</li><br>
<li>
<b>Prevents the Mind From Becoming Overworked</b>—Physical labour will not prevent the cultivation of the intellect. Far from it. The advantages gained by physical labour will balance a person and prevent the mind from being overworked
</li><br>
<li>
<b>Without Exercise, Mind Cannot Be in Working Order </b>—For a healthy young man, stern, severe exercise is strengthening to brain, bone, and muscle. And it is an essential preparation for the difficult work of a physician. Without such exercise the mind cannot be in working order
</li><br>
<li>
<b>Equalize Mental and Physical Taxation</b>—Equalize the taxation of the mental and the physical powers, and the mind of the student will be refreshed. If he is diseased, physical exercise will often help the system to recover its normal condition

</li><br>
<li>
<b>Exercise Is a Remedial Agent</b>—When invalids have nothing to occupy their time and attention, their thoughts become centered upon themselves, and they grow morbid and irritable. Many times they dwell upon their bad feelings until they think themselves much worse than they really are and wholly unable to do anything.

<p><b>A Mysterious Interrelationship</b>—Between the mind and the body there is a mysterious and wonderful relation. They react upon each other. To keep the body in a healthy condition to develop its strength, that every part of the living machinery may act harmoniously, should be the first study of our life. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Harmony Depends Upon Conformity to Fixed Laws</b>—The harmony of creation depends upon the perfect conformity of all beings, of everything, animate and inanimate, to the law of the Creator. </li><br>

<li><b>A Harp of a Thousand Strings</b>—It is not only the privilege but the sacred duty of all to understand the laws God has established[374] in their beings.... And as they more fully understand the human body, ... they will seek to bring their bodies into subjection to the noble powers of the mind. </li><br>

<li> <b>Lack of Harmonious Action Brings Disease</b>—It is the lack of harmonious action in the human organism that brings disease. The imagination may control the other parts of the body to their injury. All parts of the system must work harmoniously. The different parts of the body, especially those remote from the heart, should receive a free circulation of blood.   </li><br>

<li> <b>Caution Concerning Overwork</b>—Remember that man must preserve his God-given talent of intelligence by keeping the physical machinery in harmonious action. Daily physical exercise is necessary to the enjoyment of health. It is not work but overwork, without periods of rest, that breaks people down, endangering the life-forces. Those who overwork soon reach the place where they work in a hopeless way.  </li><br>

<article>
<p>There is an intimate relation between the mind and the body, and in order to reach a high standard of moral and intellectual attainment, the laws that control our physical being must be heeded.</p>

<ul>

<li> <b>Mental Effort Affected by Physical Vigour</b>—We should seek to preserve the full vigour of all our powers for the accomplishment of the work before us. Whatever detracts from physical vigour weakens mental effort. Hence, every practice unfavourable to the health of the body should be resolutely shunned.</li><br>

<li> <b>The Power of Discriminating Between Right and Wrong</b>— Anything that lessens physical strength enfeebles the mind and makes it less capable of discriminating between right or wrong </li><br>

<li> <b>Physical Habits Affect the Brain</b>—The brain is the citadel of the being. Wrong physical habits affect the brain and prevent the attainment of that which the students desire—a good mental discipline. Unless the youth are versed in the science of how to care for the body as well as for the mind, they will not be successful students. Study is not the principal cause of breakdown of the mental powers. The main cause is improper diet, irregular meals, a lack of physical exercise, and careless inattention in other respects to the laws of health.  </li>
<br>
<li> <b>Idleness Weakens Brain Power</b>—The reason the youth have so little strength of brain and muscle is because they do so little in the line of useful labour.  </li>
<br>
<li> <b>Manual Labour Relaxes the Mind</b>—The whole system needs the invigorating influence of exercise in the open air. A few hours of manual labour each day would tend to renew the bodily vigour and rest and relax the mind.  </li>
<br>
<li><b>Rest Versus Stimulants</b>—Wrong physical habits injure the brain, and the whole system becomes deranged. be made to brace the wearied nerves by taking stimulants, but this will not remove the difficulty. Unless a decided change is made, unless there is an intelligent recognition of the necessity of giving the brain rest instead of stimulants, the human agent will lose his self-control and will disgrace the cause of God </li>

<p> <b>Brain Must Be Healthy</b> The brain is the organ and instrument of the mind, and controls the whole body. In order for the other parts of the system to be healthy the brain must be healthy. And in order for the brain to be healthy the blood must be pure. If by correct habits of eating and drinking the  blood is kept pure, the brain will be properly nourished. </p>

<ul>
<li> <b>The Brain Supplied With Life and Strength</b>—The human organism is a wonderful piece of machinery, but it can be abused The transformation of food into good blood is a wonderful process, and all human beings should be intelligent upon this subject. </li> 
<br>
<li> <b>Indulgence Greatest Cause of Mental Debility</b> —Indulgence of appetite is the greatest cause of physical and mental debility and lies at the foundation of the feebleness which is apparent everywhere </li>
<br>
<li> <b>Mind Confused by Improper Diet</b> Overeating befogs the brain. The most precious words may be heard and not appreciated, because the mind is confused by an improper diet.

 </li>
<br>
<li> <b>Overcrowding the Stomach Weakens the Mind</b>—Overeating, even of the most wholesome food, is to be guarded against. Nature can use no more than is required  for building up the various organs of the body, and excess clogs the system.  </li>
